## Scope ##

This package contains a plugin for the Micasaverde Vera home automation gateway

## Features ##

Lightweight one-way control plugin for XBMC Frodo JSON API using HTTP. 

## Why? ##

Initially I used the Vera-XBMC-Plugin from mrw292 and chixxi, however found it not suitable for my needs.

* I have the Vera Lite so cannot afford to run too many complex plugins, due to the memory constraints
* Persistent TCP based control was unreliable and caused my Vera to lockup sometimes when the XBMC device went to sleep
* I did not need 2-way control with UPnP event subscriptions

## Copyright ##

Initially based on Vera-XBMC-Plugin from mrw292
